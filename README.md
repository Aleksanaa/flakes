# Aleksana's flakes

This repository contains my Nix flakes organized to simplify configuration extension across different devices and nodes. I have utilized digga's rakeLeaves and flattenTree functions to avoid default.nix as much as possible.

Borrowed configurations from the following repos:

- [linyinfeng/dotfiles](https://github.com/linyinfeng/dotfiles)
- [srid/nixos-config](https://github.com/srid/nixos-config)
- [Ruixi-rebirth/flakes](https://github.com/Ruixi-rebirth/flakes)
